# Portfolio-Site

My Porfolio Site, Coded by Jacob Brewer

This project was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have made a few updates since its original state including a rework of the JavaScript used for the work showcase, and a new card that gives a breif overview of each project and a link to its github.
